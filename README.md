# ahan

This app is made mainly for compressing your downloaded mp4 file and hide it into private repo with disguised file name. No one who watches your directory never see your private video since its extension is removed. (yet it surely is preserved).
If you want to see the video, you can temporarily open the hidden(and compressed file) after decompressing it. After you watched it, the temporarily decompressed file is destroyed while preserving the mp4 data. This is the safe way to enjoy your mp4 video.

# Install

```
$ ./installer
```


# Compressing mp4

```
$ ahan -v [yourfile.mp4]
```

# Watching the mp4

```
$ ahan -o
```

Then you can see the instructions. Then you see the interactive mode, never ever press Ctrl+C but Press Enter Key after watching the video.


# Notes

I made this script mainly for enjoying the videos downloaded from xvideo, yet maybe this script helps you the people under the political pressure to investigate the video consumption. (Ex. North Korea). Please enjoy this thing and if you want some additional feature, please join this project or contact me: Twitter @keisuganodev Thank you.
